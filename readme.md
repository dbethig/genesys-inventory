## General info
An inventory tracker for the Genesys TTRPG system. Many online tools for TTRPG games skip over the inventory system and I felt it was something I could not only create, but also use.
This is my first major project where I have created the MVC framework from scratch. The aim of this is to learn by doing and showcase my level of coding knowledge.

## Technologies
* [Laragon](https://laragon.org/) - Local server

Project created with:
* PHP 7
* Bootstrap 4.5
* jQuery 3.5.1
* FontAwesome 4

## Setup
### Prerequisites
This project has been built to communicate with a SQL database.

### Installing
I have included the database table structure.

Set the db and url info via the config.php file.
```
app > config > config.php
```
